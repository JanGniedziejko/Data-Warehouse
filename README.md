# Data-Warehouse designed for High School

### The project consisted of following steps:

- - Find an organisation that we will design a data warehouse for (in this case High School [this high school does not exist btw])
- - Come up with 2 main business processes, KPI's, 2 SMART Goals, and how the data is stored (1st - Database | 2nd - Excel) (Data Generator)[/Data_Generator.py]
- - Design the database and excel file from the scratch + create a data generator that will fill up the database and excel (for 2 distinct Time Snapshots)
- Make a design of Data Warehouse and present the measures and dimensions that you need for each analytical question
- Implement Data Warehouse ( ETL + SSIS ) and set everything up (measures, KPIs, etc.)
- Create MDX queries
- Data Warehouse Optimization Report ( MOLAP, ROLAP, HOLAP with and without aggregations) 
- Data Visualization using PowerBI
